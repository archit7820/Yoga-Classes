        <div className="story1">Our humble discovery of Yoga began in 2011 while living in the bustling streets of New York City. Despite the initial challenges and sweating profusely in a packed hot class, yoga touched our souls. However, life had its own plans, and a knee injury while surfing tested our determination. But with the unwavering support and encouragement of friends we crossed paths with, we found our way back to the practice, discovering patience, healing and acceptance along the way.

     {/* <img className='bookround' onClick={handleBook} src ="./bookround.png" alt= " " width= "100px" height= "100px" /> */}
       </div></div>
        <div className="story2">Since then, yoga has become the guiding light through life's trials and triumphsâ€”a constant companion during injuries, emotional hardships, and joyous moments. We are forever grateful for the transformative journey it has bestowed upon us.
